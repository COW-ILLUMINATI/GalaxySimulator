# GalaxySimulator
A very basic N-Body simulator for visualizing galaxy collisions.

This simulator was made for my astrophysics project. Do not use it -- it sucks.

Run ``./creator.out`` to configure the simulator.
You will need to use the "Prepare Universe" to add custom galaxies to the simulation, it is not done automatically.

Run ``./simulator.out`` to simulate the system. If no window is created and you are using Nvidia hardware, ``chmod +x`` the program and try running it through Proton Experimental.

Build with ``make``
